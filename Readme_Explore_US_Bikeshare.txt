Explore US Bike share Data project

Introduction
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing system have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.
However, bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

Project Overview
In this project, i use of Python to explore data related to Bike Share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”
Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C..

Software I used and own on my machine:
Python3 (version python 3.8.3),
Anacoda (version conda 4.8.4), NumPy and Pandas installed.
Git Bash (version 2.28.0, 64-bit) as a terminal.
Atom as (version 1.50.0) a code editor.

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.
All three of the data files contain the same core six columns (Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station and User Type).
However, the Chicago and New York city files also have the following two columns: Gender and Birth Year.

Data Analysis
Statistics Computed
1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration
- total travel time 
- average travel time

4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago

The source files
- Bikeshare2.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

The Output files:
I used the bikeshare.py template file to complete the project via Atom programme.
I used the the bikeshare.py file which set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience via the terminal Git Bash programe.
I create a Explore_US_Bike_Share_Data_Project.IPYNB file via Anaconda Navigator - Jupyter Notebook to apply data analysis on the the source files (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv).
